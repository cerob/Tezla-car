\section{System Level Structural Diagram (Block Diagram)}

This is where system level structural diagram will be put. Do not forget to describe functionality of the components in the scope of the given problem.

\newpage
\section{Sequence Diagram}

Sequence Diagram would be here. You should show the high level relationships between modules clearly (you do not need to give details such as variable names and function names). The relationship between the hardwares and the software must be demonstrated in this diagram.  Explain each module as in your labs. Example Sequence Diagram for Lab 7 is provided below Figure:
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\section{LED Connections}

All the components which are controlled via LPC4088 should be connected to the board. Therefore, you should determine the pins and their functionalities. Draw the described table in the term project interim report description document. After you determine the all the pins, draw the circuit schematic for the LED circuits. \\

\begin{center}
\begin {table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
The LED name & LPC4088 PIN & Port & Pin Functionality & Reason \\\hline
Front Right LED & PIN5 & P1.24 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
Front Left LED & PIN6 & P1.23 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
Back Right LED & PIN7 & P1.20 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
Back Left LED & PIN8 & P0.21 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{LED Pins and their functionalities}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\newpage
\section{Motor - Speed Sensor Connection}

\begin {table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Speed sensor PIN & LPC4088 PIN & Port & Pin Functionality & Reason \\\hline
Power GND & PIN1 & GND & Ground & Ground is needed \\\hline
VCC & PIN44 & VU & Power input & For transferring voltage \\\hline
\shortstack{Right\\ Speed Sensor \\OUT} & PIN15 & P0.23 & T3\_CAP\_0 & \shortstack{Supports\\ Timer functionality} \\\hline
\shortstack{Left\\ Speed Sensor \\OUT} & PIN34 & P1.4 & T2\_CAP\_0 & \shortstack{Supports\\ Timer functionality} \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Motor Driver and board PIN connections with their functionalities.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Even though two different speed sensors said to be used in the project description, our implementation can work with only one speed sensor for this part of the project. So, Left is connected to the board by design, but not needed and thus not used.


\newpage
\section{Motor - Driver Connection}

There is only one motor controller to control 4 motors. Output A is used for right motors and Output B is for left motors.

\begin {table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Motor Terminal & Motor Driver Terminal \\\hline
Motor 1 + & Output A + \\\hline
Motor 1 - & Output A - \\\hline
Motor 2 + & Output A + \\\hline
Motor 2 - & Output A - \\\hline
Motor 3 + & Output B + \\\hline
Motor 3 - & Output B - \\\hline
Motor 4 + & Output B + \\\hline
Motor 4 - & Output B - \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Motor Driver and motor connections.}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\newpage
\section{Driver - Board Connection}

Here is the table depicting relations between the board and motor controller:

\begin {table}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Motor driver PIN & LPC4088 PIN & Port & Pin Functionality & Reason \\\hline
Power GND & PIN1 & GND & Ground & Ground is needed \\\hline
+5V Power & PIN44 & Vout & Power input & For transferring voltage \\\hline
A Enable & PIN29 & P1.3 & PWM0\_1 (ENA) & Supports PWM Output \\\hline
B Enable & PIN30 & P1.2 & PWM0\_2 (ENB) & Supports PWM Output \\\hline
Logic Input 1 & PIN12 & P0.8 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
Logic Input 2 & PIN11 & P0.9 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
Logic Input 3 & PIN16 & P0.24 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
Logic Input 4 & PIN13 & P0.7 & GPIO & Supports digital I/O \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Motor Driver and board PIN connections with their functionalities.}
\end{center}
\end{table}
